A fast median filter routine written for Pascal/Delphi (and specifically for Terry Herter's MIRA program for reducing and analyzing FITS images).

This median filter routine is designed to work for floats, doubles and other data formats that cannot use a counting sourt algorithm (like traditional JPEGs).
